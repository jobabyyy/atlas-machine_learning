# In this project we will be covering the ins and outs of policy gradients within reinforcement learning.

# We will be implementing our very own policy gradient in our loop by using the monte carlo policy gradient algorithm- also called REINFORCE

##  LEARNING OBJECTIVES
- What is Policy?
- How to calculate a Policy Gradient?
- What and how to use a Monte-Carlo policy gradient?
